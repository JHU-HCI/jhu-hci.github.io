It examines the characteristics of organizations and of social contexts that influence system requirements and design and describes systems engineering processes for discovering, representing, and analyzing such information in practice. It covers the application of these factors throughout the system life cycle. Topics covered include groupware, social networks, organizational change, organizational culture, high reliability organizations, leadership, and engineering ethics.\n\nhttps://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/645.754-social-and-organizational-factors-in-human-systems-engineering",
