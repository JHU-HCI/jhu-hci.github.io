							<h3>September 27, 2019 – <strong>Prof. Marynel Vázquez</strong> – Yale University</h3>
						</header>
						<!-- <p><strong>Enabling Machines with Situational Awareness, Communication, and Decision-Making Abilities Leveraging Multimodal Information</strong></p> -->
						<img class='speaker-pic' src='images/speakers/vazquez.jpg' align='left'>
						<p>Marynel will have a fireside chat with students about human-centered robotics in the <a href="http://intuitivecomputing.jhu.edu">Intuitive Computing Laboraroty</a>.</p>
						<p>Marynel Vázquez is a computer scientist and roboticist. Her research focuses on understanding how to build interactive computing technologies that are meaningful, intuitive, and appropriate for users, especially in complex social environments. In particular, her research agenda centers on enabling social interactions between robots and multiple people. She creates systems that support these interactions and studies the intricacies of these encounters to understand how we can make robots better social actors. Marynel’s research crosses the boundaries between Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interaction, and often combines elements from robot perception, computer vision, machine learning, social science, and design.</p>

							<h3>October 3, 2019 – <strong>Prof. Zhou Yu</strong> – UC Davis</h3>
						</header>
						<!-- <p><strong>Enabling Machines with Situational Awareness, Communication, and Decision-Making Abilities Leveraging Multimodal Information</strong></p> -->
						<img class='speaker-pic' src='images/speakers/yu.jpg' align='left'>
						<p>Humans interact with other humans or the world through information from various channels
							including vision, audio, language, haptics, etc. To simulate intelligence, machines require
							similar abilities to process and combine information from different channels to acquire
							better situation awareness, better communication ability, and better decision-making
							ability. In this talk, we describe three projects. In the first study, we enable a robot to
							utilize both vision and audio information to achieve better user understanding. Then we use
							incremental language generation to improve the robot's communication with a human. In the
							second study, we utilize multimodal history tracking to optimize policy planning in
							task-oriented visual dialogs. In the third project, we tackle the well-known trade-off
							between dialog response relevance and policy effectiveness in visual dialog generation. We
							propose a new machine learning procedure that alternates from supervised learning and
							reinforcement learning to optimum language generation and policy planning jointly in visual
							dialogs. We will also cover some recent ongoing work on image synthesis through dialogs, and
							generating social multimodal dialogs with a blend of GIF and words.</p>
						<p>Zhou Yu is an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department at UC Davis. She
							received her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017. Zhou is interested in building
							robust and multi-purpose dialog systems using fewer data points and less annotation. She
							also works on language generation, vision and language tasks. Zhou's work on persuasive
							dialog systems received an ACL 2019 best paper nomination recently. Zhou was featured in
							Forbes as 2018 30 under 30 in Science for her work on multimodal dialog systems. Her team
							recently won the 2018 Amazon Alexa Prize on building an engaging social bot for a $500,000
							cash award.</p>

							<h3>November 7, 2019 – <strong>Prof. Jodi Forlizzi</strong> – Carnegie Mellon University
							</h3>
						</header>
						<img class='speaker-pic' src='images/speakers/forlizzi.jpg' align='left'>
						<p>A recent New York Times article boldly stated that the Golden Age of Design is upon us. Our
							society is certainly in the midst of a great shift in how we view the world. In the past
							century, we have moved from the Age of Craft to the Industrial Age; we are currently on the
							cusp of the Age of Information. In the 20th century, innovations including the personal
							computer, the internet, smart phones, cloud computing, wearable computers and 3D and CNC
							printing have helped to radically change our conception of what we design. Today, designers
							no longer create products; they instead create platforms for open innovation.

							This talk will reflect my walk through the discipline of design’s many eras and shifts, in
							order to understand this movement from designing products to designing platforms. The eras
							of user-centered design, experience design, service design, and systems design will be
							explored to better understand this migration. An alternative framing, product-service
							ecologies, will be introduced to stress a systemic and ecological view as a design approach
							to designing the products, services, environments, and platforms of today. A systemic view
							ensures that the designer can identify a need and understand the implications of designing
							something to impact the ecology in a positive way. A systemic view helps move the designer
							from problem solving to problem seeking, from modeling to understanding relationships, and
							from prototyping to perturbing the system to understand outcomes. It also ensures that
							designers are creating pragmatic and purposeful systems that will improve the state of
							today’s world.</p>
						<p>Jodi Forlizzi is the Geschke Director and a Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the
							School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. She is responsible for
							establishing design research as a legitimate form of research in HCI that is different from,
							but equally as important as, scientific and human science research. For the past 20 years,
							Jodi has advocated for design research in all forms, mentoring peers, colleagues, and
							students in its structure and execution, and today it is an important part of the CHI
							community.

							Jodi’s current research interests include designing educational games that are engaging and
							effective, designing robots, AVs, and other technology services that use AI and ML to adapt
							to people’s needs, and designing for healthcare. Jodi is a member of the ACM CHI Academy and
							has been honored by the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for excellence in HRI design
							research. Jodi has consulted with Disney and General Motors to create innovative
							product-service systems.</p>
