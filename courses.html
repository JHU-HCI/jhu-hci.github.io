									<h3><strong>EN.601.486/686 MACHINE LEARNING: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM DESIGN &
											DEVELOPMENT</strong></h3>
								</a>
								<p><b>Instructor: </b>
									<a href="people.html#Mathias_Unberath">Mathias Unberath</a> </p>
							</header>
							<p>The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently seen a substantial increase in
								popularity, largely fueled by the
								successes of training deep neural networks that achieve state-of-the-art performance in
								a large variety of problems.
								These successes are not limited to academic benchmarks but have started to impact our
								everyday lives in the form of
								products such as Google Lens, Amazon Alexa, and Tesla Autopilot. In order for such AI
								systems to succeed we must
								consider its impact on everyday life, its overall capabilities and performance, and the
								effectiveness of the human-AI
								interaction. The importance of harmonic interplay between all these components is
								dramatically highlighted by recent
								catastrophic events in road transport and aviation.
								In this project-based course you
								will work in teams of 3-5 students
								to 1) Identify a need with high-impact implications on everyday life; 2) Conceptualize
								and design an AI system targeting
								this need, and 3) Develop the AI system by refining a demo-able prototype based on
								feedback received during course
								presentations.</p>

								</a>
								<p><b>Instructor: </b>
									<a href="people.html#Joanne_Selinski">Joanne Selinski</a> </p>
							</header>
							<p>This course will provide students with a rich development experience, focused on the
								design and implementation of user
								interfaces and mobile applications. A brief overview of human computer interaction
								will provide context for designing,
								prototyping and evaluating user interfaces. Students will invent their own mobile
								applications and implement them using
								the Android SDK, which is JAVA based. An overview of the Android platform and
								available technologies will be provided,
								as well as XML for layouts, and general concepts for effective mobile development.
								Students will be expected to explore
								and experiment with outside resources in order to learn technical details
								independently. There will also be an emphasis
								on building teamwork skills, and on using modern development techniques and tools.

							</header>
							<p>In Multidisciplinary Design, teams of students with disparate engineering backgrounds
								will come together to tackle
								design challenges for a project partner. While practicing a user-centered design
								thinking process, teams will understand
								the essential need behind a problem, prototype solutions, test their prototypes, and
								present a final solution to their
								project partner. Students will also learn to collaborate among different working
								styles, and they will introduce their
								peers to new skill sets from their engineering discipline.</p>

								<p><b>Instructor: </b>
									<a href="people.html#Chien-Ming_Huang">Chien-Ming Huang</a> </p>
							</header>
							<p>This course is designed to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to design
								techniques and practices in
								human-computer interaction (HCI), the study of interactions between humans and
								computing systems. Students will learn
								design techniques and evaluation methods, as well as current practices and
								exploratory approaches, in HCI through
								lectures, readings, and assignments. Students will practice various design
								techniques and evaluation methods through
								hands-on projects focusing on different computing technologies and application
								domains. This course is intended for
								undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science/Cognitive
								Science/Psychology. Interested students from different
								disciplines should contact the instructor before enrolling in this course</p>

							</header>
							<p>This course is designed to introduce advanced students to research methods and topics
								in human-robot interaction (HRI),
								an emerging research area focusing on the design and evaluation of interactions
								between humans and robotic technologies.
								Students will (1) learn design principles for building and research methods of
								evaluating interactive robot systems
								through lectures, readings, and assignments, (2) read and discuss relevant
								literature to gain sufficient knowledge of
								various research topics in HRI, and (3) work on a substantial project that
								integrates the principles, methods, and
								knowledge learned in this course.</p>
